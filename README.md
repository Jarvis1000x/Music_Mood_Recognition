# Bi-Modal Music Mood Recognition with Audio and Lyrics

This Repository is an implementation of [Music Mood Detection Based On Audio And Lyrics With Deep Neural Net](http://ismir2018.ircam.fr/doc/pdfs/99_Paper.pdf) by R. Delbouys et al.  tried to solve Music Emotion Recognition problem using two CNN layers and two dense layers using Deezer's music database and lyrics. Main contriubtion is using Multi-modal Architecture in Regression task. They used R square value to present the explanatory power of their models as performances.
